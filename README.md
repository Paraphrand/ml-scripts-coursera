# ml-scripts-coursera
This project was created for learning purposes.
The idea is to implement in Python all algorithms taught by Andrew Ng on his Machine Learning course in Coursera. 
The version is in Python 3.6 and its created without making use of off-the-shelf models from machine learning libraries.
